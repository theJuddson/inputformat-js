# inputformat-js
Simple, highly compatible input formating / masking jQuery plugin. Not as flexible as some other input masking tools, but what you give up in flexibility, you'll gain in consistency, compatibility and stability. I got tired of trying to get other masking / formatting plugins to do exactly what I wanted them to do, so I wrote my own.

The only dependency is jQuery.
